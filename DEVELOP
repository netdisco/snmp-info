SNMP::Info Developer Guidelines

Coding Guidelines:
    - tab-width of 4, no tab characters
    - keep POD documentation up-to-date
    - always update ChangeLog before committing
    - always update DeviceMatrix.txt before committing
    - check-in required mibs to netdisco-mibs and release new package if needed

Release and Testing Instructions: 
    - Please see misc/RELEASE in Netdisco
      ( http://netdisco.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/netdisco/misc/RELEASE?view=markup )
      and follow all testing and release guidelines

FAQ:
    - Do I have to update the version number and timestamp in modified files before committing? 
    -> No.  These are RCS tags that are automatically updated by CVS when you commit

    - Should I add changes at the top of the ChangeLog?
    -> Yes. The changelog is created one commit at a time.  If there isn't a
        section for the current version, then add one at the top and put your
        changes after.  You can leave the date field for the release empty (). 

    - What should I change the $VERSION to?
    -> If you are the first person to get to a file after a release, update it
       to either  release++ or "release++ dash cvs".   
       Example: File is marked 2.01, change it to 2.02-cvs with your new changes.
       Example: File is marked 2.02-cvs,  no change until packaging for release when the -cvs is removed.
       TODO: Is there still an odd/even scheme as introduced by Eric?
