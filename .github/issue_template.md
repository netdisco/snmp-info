the more info you can provide, the easier it is for us the help you, so please

Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above

when including netdisco config snippets, whitespace matters since it's a yaml file
for github issues it really helps if you include the relevant config parts in a codeblock (code fencing)
see the "code" subject on https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for that)
this should preserve spaces in the issue tracker and make troubleshooting quicker
