   [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * Rewrite of L3::Aruba, now supports pseudo ENTITY-MIB methods to gather
      module information, more interface information for APs, more
      wireless information to include client stats, and arpnip information
      from wireless clients.  WARNING: AP device interfaces are now based on
      AP MAC and radio versus BSSID to align with other wireless classes.
    * [#64] Add i_speed_admin() to L2::2900 (psychiatric)
    * [#66] Support for VSS via CISCO-VIRTUAL-SWITCH-MIB in L3::6500

    [API Changes]

    * The methods c_ip(), c_if(), c_port(), c_id(), and c_platform() now
      represent common topology methods and will try to return a combined
      hash of data from all L2 topology protocols either running on the
      device or specified in the method call.  The topology specific methods
      have been been prefixed with the protocol name in lowercase so that
