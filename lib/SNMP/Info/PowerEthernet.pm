SNMP::Info::PowerEthernet - SNMP Interface to data stored in
F<POWER-ETHERNET-MIB>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you.
 my $poe = new SNMP::Info(
                          AutoSpecify => 1,
                          Debug       => 1,
                          DestHost    => 'myswitch',
                          Community   => 'public',
                          Version     => 2
                        )
    or die "Can't connect to DestHost.\n";

 my $class      = $poe->class();
 print "SNMP::Info determined this device to fall under subclass : $class\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

F<POWER-ETHERNET-MIB> is used to describe PoE (IEEE 802.3af)

Create or use a device subclass that inherit this class.  Do not use directly.

For debugging purposes you can call this class directly as you would
SNMP::Info

 my $poe = new SNMP::Info::PowerEthernet (...);

=head2 Inherited Classes

none.

=head2 Required MIBs

=over

=item F<POWER-ETHERNET-MIB>

=back

=head1 GLOBALS

none.

=head1 TABLE METHODS

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of a reference
to a hash.

=head2 Power Port Table

Selected values from the C<pethPsePortTable>

=over

=item $poe->peth_port_admin()

Administrative status: is this port permitted to deliver power?

C<pethPsePortAdminEnable>

=item $poe->peth_port_status()

Current status: is this port delivering power, searching, disabled, etc?

C<pethPsePortDetectionStatus>

=item $poe->peth_port_class()

Device class: if status is delivering power, this represents the 802.3af
class of the device being powered.

C<pethPsePortPowerClassifications>

=item $poe->peth_port_ifindex()

A mapping function from the C<pethPsePortTable> INDEX of
module.port to an C<ifIndex>.  The default mapping ignores the
module (returning undef if there are any module values greater
than 1) and returns the port number, assuming that there is a
1:1 mapping.

This mapping is more or less left up to the device vendor to
implement; the MIB gives only very weak guidance.
A given device class may implement its own version
of this function (e.g., see Info::CiscoPower).

=item $poe->peth_port_neg_power()

The power, in milliwatts, that has been committed to this port.
This value is derived from the 802.3af class of the device being
powered, but may be overridden by a subclass that has information
from another source (e.g., if a different protocol, such as CDP,
was used to negotiate the power level.)

=back

=head2 Power Supply Table

=over

=item $poe->peth_power_watts()

The power supply's capacity, in watts.

C<pethMainPsePower>

=item $poe->peth_power_status()

The power supply's operational status.

C<pethMainPseOperStatus>

=item $poe->peth_power_consumption()

How much power, in watts, this power supply has been committed to
deliver.  (Note: certain devices seem to supply this value in milliwatts,
so be cautious interpreting it.)

C<pethMainPseConsumptionPower>

=item $poe->peth_power_threshold()

The threshold (in percent) of consumption required to raise an
alarm.

C<pethMainPseUsageThreshold>

=back

=cut
