SNMP::Info::Layer1 - SNMP Interface to network devices serving Layer1 only.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you.
 my $l1 = new SNMP::Info(
                          AutoSpecify => 1,
                          Debug       => 1,
                          DestHost    => 'myswitch',
                          Community   => 'public',
                          Version     => 2
                        )
    or die "Can't connect to DestHost.\n";

 my $class = $l1->class();
 print "SNMP::Info determined this device to fall under subclass : $class\n";

 # Let's get some basic Port information
 my $interfaces = $l1->interfaces();
 my $i_up       = $l1->i_up();
 my $i_speed    = $l1->i_speed();

 foreach my $iid (keys %$interfaces) {
    my $port  = $interfaces->{$iid};
    my $up    = $i_up->{$iid};
    my $speed = $i_speed->{$iid}
    print "Port $port is $up. Port runs at $speed.\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is usually used as a superclass for more specific device classes
listed under SNMP::Info::Layer1::*   Please read all docs under SNMP::Info
first.

Provides abstraction to the configuration information obtainable from a
Layer1 device through SNMP.  Information is stored in a number of MIBs.

For speed or debugging purposes you can call the subclass directly, but not
after determining a more specific class using the method above.

 my $l1 = new SNMP::Info::Layer1(...);

See L<SNMP::Info/"REQUIREMENTS"> for its MIB requirements.

=head1 GLOBALS

These are methods that return scalar value from SNMP

=over

=item $l1->slots()

Number of 'groups' in the Repeater MIB

(C<rptrGroupCapacity>)
