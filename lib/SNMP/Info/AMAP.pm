=head1 DESCRIPTION

SNMP::Info::AMAP is a subclass of SNMP::Info that provides an object oriented
interface to Alcatel Mapping Adjacency Protocol (AMAP) information through
SNMP.

AMAP is a Layer 2 protocol that allows a network device to advertise its
identity and capabilities on the local network providing topology information.

Create or use a device subclass that inherits this class.  Do not use
directly.

=head2 Inherited Classes

None.

=head2 Required MIBs

=over

=item F<ALCATEL-IND1-INTERSWITCH-PROTOCOL-MIB>

=back

=head1 GLOBALS

These are methods that return scalar values from SNMP

=over

=item $amap->hasAMAP()

Is AMAP is active in this device?

=back

=head1 TABLE METHODS

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of a reference
to a hash.

=over

=item $amap->amap_id()

Returns the string value used to identify the remote system.

=item $amap->amap_if()

Returns the mapping to the SNMP Interface Table.

=item  $amap->amap_ip()

Returns remote IPv4 addresses.  Note: AMAP returns all IP addresses associated
with the remote device.  It would be preferable to include only one address
since they should all originate from the same device, but amap_ip() can not
determine if all addresses are reachable from the network management
application therefore all addresses are returned and the calling application
must determine which address to use and if they are in fact from the same
device.

=item $amap->amap_port()

Returns remote port ID

=item $amap->amap_platform()

Returns remote platform ID

=back
