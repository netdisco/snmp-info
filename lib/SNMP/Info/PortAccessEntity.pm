SNMP::Info::PortAccessEntity - SNMP Interface to data stored in
F<IEEE8021-PAE-MIB>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you.
 my $pae = new SNMP::Info(
                          AutoSpecify => 1,
                          Debug       => 1,
                          DestHost    => 'myswitch',
                          Community   => 'public',
                          Version     => 2
                        )
    or die "Can't connect to DestHost.\n";

 my $class      = $pae->class();
 print "SNMP::Info determined this device to fall under subclass : $class\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

F<IEEE8021-PAE-MIB> is used to describe Port Access Entities, aka NAC/dot1x features.

Create or use a device subclass that inherit this class.  Do not use directly.

For debugging purposes you can call this class directly as you would
SNMP::Info

 my $pae = new SNMP::Info::PortAccessEntity (...);

=head2 Inherited Classes

none.

=head2 Required MIBs

=over

=item F<IEEE8021-PAE-MIB>

=back

=head1 GLOBALS

none.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $pae->pae_control()

The administrative enable/disable state for Port Access Control in a System.
Possible values are enabled and disabled.

C<dot1xPaeSystemAuthControl>

=back

=head1 TABLE METHODS

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of a reference
to a hash.

=over

=item $pae->pae_authconfig_state()

Authentication state: is the port authenticated, disconnected, etc. 

C<dot1xAuthPaeState>

=item $pae->pae_authconfig_port_status()

Controlled Port status parameter for the Port: can only be authorized or unauthorized

C<dot1xAuthAuthControlledPortStatus>

=item $pae->pae_authsess_user()

The User-Name representing the identity of the Supplicant PAE. This can be a pretty
arbitrary string besides an actual username, e.g. a MAC address for MAB or a hostname
for dot1x.

C<dot1xAuthSessionUserName>

=item $pae->pae_authsess_mab()

Helper method, guess if this a mac address bypass port: contains the string "mab" for indexes where the 
pae_authsess_user looks like a MAC address.
