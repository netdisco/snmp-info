 # Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you.
 my $info = new SNMP::Info(
                          AutoSpecify => 1,
                          Debug       => 1,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides access to Aggregated Links configuration on Cisco devices.
It combines Cisco PAgP, Cisco proprietary info and IEEE 802.3ad information.

Use or create in a subclass of SNMP::Info.  Do not use directly.

=head1 TABLE METHODS

=over 4

=item C<agg_ports>

Returns a HASH reference mapping from slave to master port for each member of
a port bundle on the device. Keys are ifIndex of the slave ports, Values are
ifIndex of the corresponding master ports.

=item C<agg_ports_cisco>

Implements the cisco LAG info retrieval. Merged into C<agg_ports> data
automatically. Will fetch all members of C<clagAggPortListInterfaceIndexList>
even if they are not running an aggregation protocol.

=item C<agg_ports_pagp>

Implements the PAgP LAG info retrieval. Merged into C<agg_ports> data
automatically.

=item C<lag_members>

Mimics C<ad_lag_ports> from L<SNMP::Info::IEEE802dot3ad> but based on ifindex
instead of instead of bp_index.

=back

=head2 OVERRIDES

=over

=item C<agg_ports_lag>

This will retrieve LAG ports based on C<dot3adAggPortSelectedAggID> data.
It will be merged into C<agg_ports> data.

=head1 MUNGES

=over

=item C<munge_port_ifindex>

Takes C<clagAggPortListInterfaceIndexList>, uses the index as master port, then
returns all members as ifindex. Works with single or multiple slaves to a master.
