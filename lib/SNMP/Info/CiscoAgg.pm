 # Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you. 
 my $info = new SNMP::Info(

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides access to Aggregated Links configuration on Cisco devices.
It combines Cisco PAgP and IEEE 802.3ad information.

Use or create in a subclass of SNMP::Info.  Do not use directly.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<agg_ports>

Returns a HASH reference mapping from slave to master port for each member of
a port bundle on the device. Keys are ifIndex of the slave ports, Values are
ifIndex of the corresponding master ports.

=item C<agg_ports_pagp>

Implements the PAgP LAG info retrieval. Merged into C<agg_ports> data
automatically.
