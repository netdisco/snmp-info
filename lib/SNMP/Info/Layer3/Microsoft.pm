=head1 GLOBALS

These are methods that return scalar value from SNMP

=head2 Overrides

=head1 TABLE METHODS

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of a reference
to a hash.

=head2 Overrides

=over

=item $router->interfaces()

Map the Interfaces to their physical names.  Adds interface number to
interface name because identical interface cards return identical C<ifDescr>.
