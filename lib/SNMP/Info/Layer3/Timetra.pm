                        Debug       => 1,
                        # These arguments are passed directly to SNMP::Session
                        DestHost    => 'myswitch',

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subclass for Alcatel-Lucent Service Routers

=head2 Inherited Classes

=over

=item SNMP::Info::Layer3

=back

=head2 Required MIBs

=over

=item F<TIMETRA-GLOBAL-MIB>

=item Inherited Classes' MIBs

See L<SNMP::Info::Layer3/"Required MIBs"> for its own MIB requirements.

=back

=head1 GLOBALS

These are methods that return scalar value from SNMP

=over

=item $alu->vendor()

Returns 'alcatel-lucent'

=item $alu->os()

Returns 'TiMOS'

=item $alu->os_ver()

Grabs the version string from C<sysDescr>.

=item $alu->model()

Tries to reference $alu->id() to one of the product MIBs listed above

Removes 'tmnxModel' from the name for readability.

=back

=head2 Globals imported from SNMP::Info::Layer3

See documentation in L<SNMP::Info::Layer3/"GLOBALS"> for details.

=head1 TABLE METHODS

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of a reference
to a hash.

=over

=item $alu->interfaces()

Returns C<ifName>, since the default Layer3 C<ifDescr> varies based
upon the transceiver inserted.
