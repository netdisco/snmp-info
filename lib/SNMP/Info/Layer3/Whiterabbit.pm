SNMP::Info::Layer3::Whiterabbit - SNMP Interface to Whiterabbit Switches

=head1 AUTHOR

Christoph Handel

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you.
 my $whiterabbit = new SNMP::Info(
                          AutoSpecify => 1,
                          Debug       => 1,
                          DestHost    => 'myswitch',
                          Community   => 'public',
                          Version     => 2
                        )
    or die "Can't connect to DestHost.\n";

 my $class      = $whiterabbit->class();
 print "SNMP::Info determined this device to fall under subclass : $class\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides abstraction to the configuration information obtainable from a
Whiterabbit Switch via SNMP.

=head2 Inherited Classes

=over

=item SNMP::Info::Layer3

=item SNMP::Info::MAU

=back

=head2 Required MIBs

=over

=item F<WR-SWITCH-MIB>

=item F<WRS-PRODUCTS-MIB>

=back

L<https://github.com/GSI-CS-CO/wrs_mibs.git>

=head1 GLOBALS

These are methods that return scalar value from SNMP

=over

=item $whiterabbit->layers()

Overwrite snmp value, we support 1-3

=item $whiterabbit->os()

statically returns whiterabbit

=item $whiterabbit->vendor()

return manufacturer as read from device. e.g. seven solutions, creotech, etc.

=item $whiterabbit->model()

as returned by mib. no meaningful translation

=item $whiterabbit->mac()

use the dot1dBaseBridgeAddress

=item $whiterabbit->os_ver()

including git hash
