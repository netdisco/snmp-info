=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Let SNMP::Info determine the correct subclass for you.
 use SNMP::Info;
 my $cnos = new SNMP::Info(
                          AutoSpecify => 1,
                          Debug       => 1,
                          DestHost    => 'myrouter',
                          Community   => 'public',
                          Version     => 2
                        )
    or die "Can't connect to DestHost.\n";
 my $class = $cnos->class();
 print "SNMP::Info determined this device to fall under subclass : $class\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subclass for Lenovo switches running CNOS.

See L<SNMP::Info::Layer3> for its own MIB requirements.

=head1 GLOBALS

These are methods that return scalar value from SNMP.

=over

=item $cnos->mac()

Returns base mac based on C<dot1dBaseBridgeAddress>.

=item $cnos->os_ver()

Returns the OS version extracted from C<entPhysicalSoftwareRev.1>.

=back

=head2 Overrides

=over

=item $cnos->vendor()

Returns 'lenovo'.

=item $cnos->os()

Returns 'cnos'.

=head2 Globals imported from SNMP::Info::Layer3

=head1 TABLE ENTRIES

These are methods that return tables of information in the form of a reference
to a hash.

=over

=item $cnos->agg_ports_cnos()

placeholder function, will return agg_ports mapping once implemented.

=back

=head2 Overrides

=over

=item $cnos->i_description()

Uses C<ifName> to match most other devices.

=item $cnos->i_name()

Uses C<ifDescr> to match most other devices.

=item $cnos->i_speed()

CNOS does not set C<ifSpeed> to 4294967295 for high speed links, return
C<orig_if_speed_high()> instead. SNMP::Info will handle this correctly.

=item $cnos->i_speed_raw()

If C<ifSpeedHigh> > 2500 we overwrite C<i_speed_raw()>, using the
formula: C<ifSpeedHigh> * 1_000_000.
